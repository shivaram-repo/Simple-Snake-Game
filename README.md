# 🐍 Simple Snake Game – JavaScript Project

- A modern implementation of the classic Snake Game built using **JavaScript**, designed to demonstrate practical understanding of core front-end development concepts and interactive game logic.

- This project focuses on translating JavaScript fundamentals into a real-world application while ensuring smooth gameplay and responsiveness across devices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- The Snake Game is a browser-based interactive game where the player controls a snake to collect food and increase its length while avoiding collisions with walls. The game includes real-time score tracking, high score persistence, and mobile-friendly swipe controls.

- This project was developed as part of my learning journey to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript mechanics.
